# WebScraper

This script performs web-scraping from https://www.dissernet.org/. 
It was created in order to collect texts which will be used as a testing material for another programme - [ShingleAlgorithm](https://github.com/blindsphynx/TextPreprocessingAndShingleAlgorithm).

```getLinksFromTable(link)``` returns an array of hyperlinks from the table

```getTexts(link)``` returns texts from HTML page
